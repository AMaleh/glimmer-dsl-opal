# TODO

Here is a list of tasks to do (moved to CHANGELOG.md once done). 

## Next (0.1.0)

- opal-rspect test coverage
- opal-jquery refactoring

## Issues

- Fix list selection so it always requires holding meta key

## Tasks

- Listeners
- Basic data-binding
- Radio button
- Checkbox button
- Support multiple windows as multiple tabs
- Support different themes by detecting browser OS (Mac, Windows, Linux)
- Support Document.ready? as part of Glimmer's top level keywords so clients don't need to use it
- Test and document opal-hot-reloader as an option for hot loading glimmer-dsl-opal

## Samples

- Glimmer Blog
- Put all internal samples up online
- Forum (that allows no more than one message without a reply, requiring a reply before you make another reply, thus auto-moderating itself)
- Twitter
- Reddit (without thumb downs though)
- Facebook
- StackOverflow
